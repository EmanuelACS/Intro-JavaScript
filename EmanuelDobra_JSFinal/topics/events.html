    <h1>2.3 Events</h1>
    <p>
        HTML events can be defined as something that the browser or user does which happen to HTML elements. When an event happens, you usually want to do something. Here is a browser event example: a HTML page which has finished loading, here is a user event
        example: a button was clicked. Both of these are events, and most of the time things will happen when these events are triggered, such as rendering the page or executing some code.
    </p>
    <p>So where does JavaScript fit in? JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected. and HTML allows event handler attributes, with JavaScript code, to be added to HTML elements.</p>

    <p>
        Event handlers can be used to handle, and verify, user input, user actions, and browser actions:
        <br/><br/> - Things that should be done every time a page loads
        <br/> - Things that should be done when the page is closed
        <br/> - Action that should be performed when a user clicks a button
        <br/> - Content that should be verified when a user inputs data and much more...
    </p>
    <p>
        Different methods can be used to let JavaScript work with events:
        <br/><br/> - HTML event attributes can execute JavaScript code directly
        <br/> - HTML event attributes can call JavaScript functions
        <br/> - You can assign your own event handler functions to HTML elements and much more...
    </p>

    <h2>List of Events</h2>
    <p>HTML has events for Window attributes, Forms, Keyboard, Mouse, Drag, Media, and so on. Here are just of few of these events: </p>
    <p>
        <br/><em>onchange</em>: An HTML element has been changed
        <br/><em>onclick</em>: The user clicks an HTML element
        <br/><em>onmouseover</em>: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
        <br/><em>onmouseout</em>: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
        <br/><em>onkeydown</em>: The user pushes a keyboard key
        <br/><em>onload</em>: The browser has finished loading the page
        <br/><em>dblclick</em>: The event occurs when the user double-clicks on an element
        <br/><em>drag</em>: The event occurs when an element is being dragged
        <br/><em>drop</em>: The event occurs when the dragged element is dropped on the drop target
        <br/><em>load</em>: The event occurs when an object has loaded
        <br/><em>mousedown</em>: The event occurs when the user presses a mouse button over an element
        <br/><em>mouseover</em>: The event occurs when the pointer is moved onto an element, or onto one of its children
        <br/><em>mouseup</em>: The event occurs when a user releases a mouse button over an element
        <br/><em>resize</em>: The event occurs when the document view is resized
        <br/><em>scroll</em>: The event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled
        <br/><em>show</em>: The event occurs when a &lt;menu> element is shown as a context menu
    </p>

    <h2>General Syntax</h2>
    <p>The <em>.</em> notation is used to access specific events.</p>
    <pre><code>
    // element is the document's element name 
    // oneventname is the event that is looked for
    // functionName is the function that should be triggered on event
    element.oneventname = functionName() {
        // Block of code to run
    }
    </code></pre>
    <h2>Examples</h2>
    <p id="to_change" style="cursor: crosshair;">Hover over me after clicking the button!</p>
    <pre><code>
    // Here we use the onmouseover and onmouseout events to trigger color change
    // Get the id of the above paragraph
    var el = document.getElementById("to_change");
    // trigger function mouseOver() to element on event
    el.onmouseover = function() {
        mouseOver()
    };
    // trigger function mouseOut() to element on event
    el.onmouseout = function() {
        mouseOut()
    };

    // Function to be triggered onmouseover
    function mouseOver() {
        el.style.color = "red";
    }

    // Function to be triggered onmouseout 
    function mouseOut() {
        el.style.color = "yellow";
    }
    </code></pre>
    <button class="button" onclick="runChangeCol_onClick()">Try me!</button>
    <script>
        function runChangeCol_onClick() {
            var el = document.getElementById("to_change");
            el.onmouseover = function() {
                mouseOver()
            };
            el.onmouseout = function() {
                mouseOut()
            };

            // Function to be triggered onmouseover
            function mouseOver() {
                el.style.color = "red";
            }

            // Function to be triggered onmouseout 
            function mouseOut() {
                el.style.color = "yellow";
            }
        }
    </script>
    <p>Here is another way to use events using the <em>addEventListener()</em> method. This way you can add the events you want an element to look for in a simple manner, click on the text below to try it yourself!</p>
    <p id="change_text" style="cursor: pointer;">Clicking me now will do nothing. Click me after you press the button and see how I change!</p>
    <pre><code>
    // Get element using getElementById() method
    var el = document.getElementById("change_text");
    // Using addEventListener to make the document look for a click event
    // and executing myFunction once a click event happens
    el.addEventListener("click", changeText);

    // Function that changes text using the innerHTML property
    function changeText() {
        el.innerHTML = "YOU CLICKED ME!!!";
    }
    </code></pre>
    <button class="button" onclick="runChangeText_onClick()">Try me!</button>
    <script>
        function runChangeText_onClick() {
            var el = document.getElementById("change_text");
            el.addEventListener("click", changeText);

            function changeText() {
                el.innerHTML = "YOU CLICKED ME!!!";
            }
        }
    </script>
</body>
